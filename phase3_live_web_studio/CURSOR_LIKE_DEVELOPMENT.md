# ðŸš€ Cursor-Like Development System

## Overview
WebWeaver now implements surgical code editing similar to Cursor IDE, with memory, state preservation, and incremental development that doesn't break existing functionality.

## ðŸ”§ Key Problems Solved

### 1. **Sites Looking Similar**
**Before**: Generic prompts led to similar-looking websites
**After**: Detailed 5-step specification gathering creates truly custom designs

- Design style preferences (Modern, Corporate, Creative, etc.)
- Comprehensive color scheme options

### 2. **Breaking Previous Fixes (Contact Form Issue)**
**Before**: Each change regenerated large chunks, breaking working elements
**After**: Surgical editing preserves all working functionality

- **Preserved Elements Detection**: Automatically identifies forms, navigation, buttons
- **Targeted Modifications**: Only changes specific requested elements
- **Validation**: Prevents changes that break existing functionality

### 3. **Not Truly Incremental**

**After**: True surgical edits like Cursor IDE

**Cursor-Like Features**:
- Preserves working CSS rules (animations, responsive design, forms)
- Maintains HTML structure and class names
- Makes minimal targeted changes
- Never breaks existing functionality
- Builds progressively on previous work

## ðŸ§  Memory & State System

### Website Context Tracking
```javascript
{

  business_type: "consulting", 
  key_features: ["contact form", "pricing section"],
  style_preferences: {
    design_style: "Professional Corporate",
    primary_color: "#2c3e50"
  },
  evolution_log: [...] // All changes with timestamps
}
```

### Conversation Memory
- Last 10 interactions with full context
- User intent progression tracking
- Building vs. redirecting detection
- Context-aware change analysis

### Incremental Change Log
- Change type classification (incremental/major/redirect)
- Scope tracking (small/medium/large)
- Areas affected (content/structure/styling/features)
- Detailed descriptions and timestamps

## ðŸŽ¯ Custom Website Generation

### Enhanced Initial Specifications
1. **Purpose & Industry**: Detailed business context
2. **Business Details**: Name, focus, target audience
3. **Design Style**: 8 style options with color schemes
4. **Features**: Core sections + special functionality
5. **Content Strategy**: Key messages, unique selling points

### Truly Custom Prompts
**Before**:
```
"Create a website with these sections: hero, about, contact"
```

**After**:
```
"Create a custom SAP consultancy website for Fortune 500 CTOs, 
focusing on implementation expertise, with Professional Corporate 
design, emphasizing '20+ years experience' and 'certified partner 
status', including pricing section and client testimonials"
```

## ðŸ”¬ Surgical Editing Process

### 1. Change Analysis
```javascript

  needs_html_update: true|false,
  needs_css_update: true|false,
  priority_areas: ["content", "styling"],
  building_on_previous: true,
  scope: "small|medium|large"
}
```

### 2. Preservation Detection

- Buttons and their functionality
- Section structure and layout

**CSS Rules Preserved**:
- Animations and transitions
